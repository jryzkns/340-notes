\section*{MATH340 Review Notes}

By Jack `jryzkns' Zhou

\section{Axiomatic Approach to $\mathbb{N}$}

\textbf{Definition}: $\mathbb{N}$ is a set with 3 axioms (sometimes referred to as the "Peano Axioms"):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1 \in \mathbb{N}$
    \item For every $a \in \mathbb{N}$, there is an element called the \textit{successor} of $a$, written as $succ(a) = a+1 \in \mathbb{N}$
    \item Every element $a \in \mathbb{N}$ arises in this manner: \[\mathbb{N} = \{succ^{k}(1) \; | \; k \geq 0\}\]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mathematical Induction}

\textbf{Principle of Mathematical Induction}:

Suppose $X \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1 \in X$
    \item $a \in X \Rightarrow a+1 \in X$
\end{enumerate}
Then $X = \mathbb{N}$.

This is taken as an axiom and cannot be proven from the 3 axioms presented in section 1.

\textbf{Strong Induction}:

Suppose $X \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ satusfies the properties

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1 \in X$
    \item $\forall i \in [1,n] \;\; i \in X \Rightarrow n+1 \in X$

\end{enumerate}

This variant of induction is logically equivalent to the simple form of induction, but in a proof it may be desirable to refer to more than 1 case that is taken to be true, in which case a strong induction is preferred.

\textbf{The Well-Ordering Principle (WP)}:

Every non-empty subset $Y \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has a minimal element.

We can use WP to prove the Principle of Induction:

Suppose $X \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has the properties $1 \in X$ and $k \in X \Rightarrow k+1 \in X$, WTS $X \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose $Y = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} \;|\; n \notin X\}$, then $X = \mathbb{N} \Leftrightarrow Y = \varnothing$

We proceed to show that $Y = \varnothing$ by contradiction, assuming $Y \neq \varnothing$. By WP, $Y$ has a minimum element $n^{*} \in Y$. As $1 \notin Y$ (because $1 \in X$), $n^* > 1$ so $n^* - 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n^* - 1 \notin Y$ because $n^*$ is the minimal element of $Y$. Therfore $n^* - 1 \in X$, but then $succ(n^* - 1) = n^* - 1 + 1 = n^* \in X$ by the inductive hypothesis. As $n^* \in Y$, we have come to a contradiction, and therefore $Y = \varnothing$ and $X = \mathbb{N}$.

\textit{Note}: WP is false for other sets of numbers. For example, there is no minimal element in $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ as $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}^{+}\;\; \frac{1}{2}x < x$.

\section{Operations on $\mathbb{N, Z}$}

\textbf{Multiplication on $\mathbb{N}$}:

Inductively defined with $1 \cdot a := a$ as the base case. If $n \cdot a$ is defined, then $(n+1) \cdot a := n \cdot a + a$.

The Peano Axioms imply the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Commutativity: $ab = ba$
    \item Associativity: $a(bc) = (ab)c$
    \item Distribution over Addition: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Defining $\mathbb{Z}$ from $\mathbb{N}$}

Suppose we want to solve an equation like $x+5 = 2$ in $\mathbb{N}$, there are no solutions, because $x = 2 -5 \notin \mathbb{N}$. Therefore, we need to invent the notion of negative numbers.

To do this, we can say that $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} = \{(a, b) \;|\; a, b \in \mathbb{N}\}$ with an equivalence relation $(a, b) = (a+c, b+c)$ for any $a, b, c \in \mathbb{N}$. The ordered tuple $(a, b)$ represents $a - b$. We can see that $(a + c) - (b + c) = a - b$. More concretely, consider $(5, 0) = (6, 1) = (500, 495)$ and $5 - 0 = 6 - 1 = 500-495$. A negative number $-a$ could then be represented as $(0, a)$.

\textbf{Induction in $\mathbb{Z}$}

WP does not apply to $\mathbb{Z}$, so in practice we either treat +ive and -ive numbers separately, or we go by the absolute value of the numbers.

\section{The Division Theorem in $\mathbb{Z}$}

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \in \mathbb{N}$. Then there exists unique $q \in \mathbb{Z}, r \in (0, b)$ such that $a = qb + r$.

\textbf{Proof}: We proceed in two steps, showing existence then uniqueness.

\textit{Existence}: We have $a \in \mathbb{Z}, b \in \mathbb{N}$, we define \[X = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\} \;|\; n = a - qb\}\] For some integer $q$. $X$ is nonempty as $a - qb \geq 0$ by choice of $q$. If $a > 0$, we pick $q = 0$. If $a \leq 0$, we pick $q = a$. By WP, $X$ has a minimal element that we will call $r$; $r = a - qb$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Z}$. Since $r \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$, $r \geq 0$. $r$ also satisfies $r < b$. If $r \geq b$, then $r - b \in X$ as $r - b = (a - qb) - b = a - (q+1)b$. This contradicts minimality of $r$. Rearranging $r = a - qb$ we get $a = qb + r$.

\textit{Uniqueness}: Suppose we have $(q_1, r_1)$ and $(q_2, r_2)$ both satisfying the theorem, WTS $q_1 = q_2$ and $r_1 = r_2$.

We have $a = q_1b + r_1 = q_2b + r_2$ with $r_1, r_2 \in (0, b)$. If we collect the terms with $b$ on one side, we have $(q_1 - q_2)b = r_2 - r_1$. So, $r_2 - r_1$ is a multiple of $b$. Given the constraint $r_1, r_2 \in (0, b)$, we can see that $r_2 - r_1 \in [-(b-1),(b-1)]$. Therefore it is only possible that $r_2 - r_1 = 0$ is a multiple a multiple of $b$. Therefore $r_2 = r_1$ and $(q_1 - q_2)b = 0 \Rightarrow q_1 = q_2$.

\subsection{What if $b < 0$?}

$a = qb + r \Leftrightarrow a = (-q)(-b) + r$. The theorem still works, but $0 \geq r \geq |b|$ needs to be guaranteed.

\section {Divisibility in $\mathbb{Z}$}

\textbf{Definition}: Let $d, a \in \mathbb{Z}$, we say that $d$ divides $a$, written as $d | a$, if $a = qd$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Equivalently: $d$ is a \textit{divisor} of $a$, $a$ is a \textit{multiple} of $d$, or $a$ is \textit{divisible} by $d$.

Some Facts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\forall d \in \mathbb{Z}\;\;d | 0$ but $0 \nmid a$ unless $a = 0$.
    \item If $d$ divides $a \neq 0$ then $|d| \leq |a|$. In particular, the set of divisors of a non-zero integer is finite.
    \item $d|a \Leftrightarrow |d| \;|\; |a|$
\end{itemize}

\section {GCD in $\mathbb{Z}$}

\textbf{Definition}: Let $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, not both 0. The \textit{greatest common divisor} of $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a, b)$ is the greatest $d \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $d | a$ and $d | b$.

\textbf{Lemmas}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $( d | a \land d | b )\rightarrow d|(a-b)$
    \item $( d | (a-b) \land d | b )\rightarrow d|a$
\end{itemize}

Note that these lemmas mean that if $d$ is a common divisor of $(a, b)$ then it is equivalent to $d$ is a common divisor of $(b, a-b)$; $\gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a- b)$.

\section{Bezout's Identity in $\mathbb{Z}$}

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $g = \gcd(a, b)$. Then $g = ax + by$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\textbf{Proof}: Suppose we have two sets:
\[\begin{aligned}
D &= \{ d \in \mathbb{Z} \;|\; d|a \land d|b \} \\
I &= \{ ax + by \;|\; x,y \in \mathbb{Z}\}
\end{aligned}\]

$D$ is the set of all common divisors between $a, b$ and $I$ is the set of all integer combinations of $a, b$.

From this we make claim (1): If $d \in D$ and $n \in I$, then $d | n$. In particular, if $n \neq 0$, $|d| \leq |n|$.

Since $d \in D$, we have $a = q_1d$ and $b = q_2d$ for some $q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, since $n \in I$, we have $n = ax + by$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$. We can see that $n = ax + by = q_1dx + q_2dy = d(q_1x + q_2y) \Rightarrow d | n$.

Suppose now we look at $I \cap \mathbb{N}$, the integer multiples of $a,b$ that are natural numbers, we let $n^* = \min(I \cap \mathbb{N}) = ax^*+by^*$.

We proceed to make claim (2) that $n^* | a$ and $n^* | a$ (i.e. $n^* \in D$).

Suppose $n^* \nmid a$, we divide $a$ by $n^*$ to get $a = qn^* + r$, $r \in (0, n^*)$. By definition of $n^*$, we see that \[\begin{aligned}
    r &= a - qn^* \\
    &= a - q(ax^* + by^*)\\
    &=a - qax^* + qby^* \\
    &=a(1 - qx^*) + b(qy^*) \\
\end{aligned}\]

This means that $n^* \in I$ and that contradicts the minimality of $n^*$ as $r \in (0, n^*)$.

Finally, we make our last claim (3): $n^* = \max(D) = \gcd(a, b)$. By claim (2), $n^*$ is a common divisor of $a, b$. If $d \in D$ is any other common divisor, then $d \leq n^*$ by claim (1). We can see that $d \leq |d| \leq |n^*| = n^*$.

Therefore, we have two interpretations of $\gcd(a, b)$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\gcd(a, b) = \max(D)$

    maximal element in set of common divisors
    \item $\gcd(a, b) = \min(I \cap \mathbb{N})$

    smallest positive integer combination of $a, b$.

\end{itemize}

\section{Euclidean Algorithm}

\textbf{Theorem}:

If $a = qb + r$, then $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r)$.

\textbf{Proof}:

It is given that $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(a - b, b)$. As $r = a - qb$, we can consider applying the $a - b$ operation $q$ times: $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - qb) = \gcd(b, r)$.

\textbf{Algorithm}

Given: $(a, b)$ with $a > b > 0$ and repeatedly apply division theorem on $(a, b)$. After each division, we replace $a$ with $b$ and $b$ with the remainder of the division:\[\begin{aligned}
    (a, b) \;\;\;& a  = q_1b + r_1 \\
    (b, r_1) \;\;\;& b  = q_2r_1 + r_2 \\
    (r_1, r_2) \;\;\;& r_1  = q_3r_2 + r_3 \\
    \vdots \;\;\;& \vdots \\
    (r_{k-2},r_{k-1}) \;\;\;& r_{k-2} = q_kr_{k-1}+ r_k \\
    (r_{k-1}, r_k) \;\;\;& r_{k-1} = q_{k+1}r_{k}+ 0 \\
    (r_k, 0) \;\;\;&
\end{aligned}\]

The algorithm stops when we reach a point where the second value in the tuple is $0$, in which case $\gcd(a, b) = r_k$.

This algorithm is guaranteed to terminate as each of the $r_i$ up to terminating $r_k$ are strictly decreasing natural numbers. By WP there is a minimal element to which this procedure will terminate on.

% TODO: talk about how to recover coefficients x, y in ax + by

\section{Factoring of Integers}

\textbf{Definition}:

An integer $p \neq \pm 1$ is said to be \textit{irreducible} if its only divisors are itself and 1 or -1.

\textbf{Definition}:

An integer $p \neq 0, \pm 1$ is said to be \textit{prime} if for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $p|ab$ implies $p|a$ or $p|b$.

\textbf{Theorem}:

If $n \in \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0,1,-1\}$, $n$ is a product of irreducible integers.

\textbf{Proof}:

We will proceed by strong induction. The base case $n=2$ is irreducible. In the general case, suppose $n > 2$ and the theorem is true for all $i \in [2, n]$. If $n$ is irreducible, then we are done. Otherwise, $n = ab$ for some $a, b \in [2, n]$, in which case $2 \geq a, b < n$ and $a, b$ are products of primes. A product of products of primes is still a product of primes.

\section{Euclid's Lemma}

\textbf{Lemma}:

An integer $p$ is prime if and only if $p$ is irreducible.

\textbf{Proof}:

$(\Rightarrow)$: Let $p$ be prime. To show that $p$ is irreducible, suppose $p = ab$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, WTS $a$ or $b$ is $\pm 1$. As $p = ab$, we know that $p|a$ or $p|b$. WLOG, suppose $p|a$. This means that $a = pd$ for some $d \in \mathbb{Z}$. So, $p = ab = (pd)b$. Suppose we divide $p = (pd)b$ by $p$, we get $1 = db$. Thereore, $d, b = \pm 1$; $p$ is irreducible.

$(\Leftarrow)$: Let $p$ be irreducible. To show that $p$ is prime, suppose $p|ab$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and show $p | a$ or $p | b$. As $p$ is irreducible, $\gcd(p, a)$ is either $1$ or $p$. If $\gcd(p, a) = p$, then $p|a$ and we are done. Otherwise, if $\gcd(p, a) = 1$, then by Bezout's Indentity, we have $1 = px + ay$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, \[b = b(px+ay) = pbx + aby\]

Note that $p|ab$ is equivalent to saying $ab = pn$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we can substitute this in:\[b = pbx + pny=p(bx+ny)\] From this we can see that $p|b=p(bx+ny)$; $p$ is prime.


\section{Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic}

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0,1,-1\}$, $n$ is a product of prime numbers. Moreover, given two prime factorizations $n = p_1 \cdots p_k = q_1 \cdots q_l$, $k=l$ and it's possible to re-enumerate $q_1,\ldots,q_l$ so that $\forall i\;\; p_i = \pm q_i$.

\textbf{Proof}:

We proceed by showing existence then uniqueness.

\textit{Existence}: This is already proven with a previous theorem showing that if $n \in \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0,1,-1\}$, $n$ is a product of irreducible integers.By Euclid's Lemma, we can also say that such $n$ is a product of prime integers.

\textit{Uniqueness}: Suppose $n = p_1 \cdots p_k = q_1 \cdots q_l$. We proceed by induction on $k$. For the base case $k = 1$, we have $n = p_1 = q_1$. In the general case, suppose $n = p_1 \cdots p_{k+1} = q_1 \cdots q_l$. We look at $p_1$, since $p_1 |n = q_1 \cdots q_l$, then $p_1|q_i$ for some $i$. Therefore $p_1 = \pm q_i$. Suppose we let let $q_i$ swap indices with $q_1$, then we have $n = p_1 \cdots p_{k+1} = q_1q_2 \cdots q_l = p_1 q_2 \cdots q_l$. We can divide $p_1 \cdots p_{k+1} = p_1 q_2 \cdots q_l$ by $p_1$, which leaves us with $p_2 \cdots p_{k+1} = q_2 \cdots q_l$ and we can repeat this procedure to set $p_j = \pm q_i$ for all remaining $j$ factors in $p_2 \cdots p_{k+1}$.

\section{Modular Arithmetic}

Let $a \mathbb{Z}$ and $m \in \mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$, where $m$ is commonly referred to as the \textit{modulus}, we explore some definitions:

\textbf{Definition}:

The \textit{residue} of $a$ modulo $m$ is the remainder of $a$ when divided by $m$.

\textbf{Definition}:

The \textit{congruence class} of $a$ modulo $m$ is defined as the set \[[a]_m := \{a' \in \mathbb{Z} \;|\; a \equiv a' (\mathrm{mod} \;m)\}\]

We say that $a$ is a \textit{representative} of $[a]_m$.

Congruence classes under the same modulus $m$ are either equal or disjoint. If $x, x' \in [a]_m$, then $x' - x | m$.

Alternatively, we can generate $[a]_m$ in the following way:\[[a]_m = \{a + km \;|\; k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\]

\textbf{Definition}:

The integers modulo $m$, $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$, is the set of congruence classes modulo $m$.

\section{Algebra and Operations on $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$}

\textbf{Definition}:

In $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$, addition is defined as \[[a]_m+[b]_m = [a+b]_m\]
and multiplication is defined as \[[a]_m \cdot [b]_m = [ab]_m\]

\textbf{Definition}:

An element $x$ is said to be \textit{invertible} if there exists an element $y$ such that $[xy]_m = [1]_m$. We say $x$ and $y$ are multiplicative inverses

\textbf{Definition}:

An element $x$ is said to be a \textit{zero divisor} if $x \neq 0$ and there exists an element $y \neq 0$ such that $[xy]_m = [0]_m$

\section{Theorems about $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$}

\textbf{Theorem}:

An element of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ cannot be both an invertible element and a zero divisor.

\textbf{Proof}:

Suppose $[a]_m$ is invertible, then there exists $[a'] \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ such that $[a]_m[a']_m = [1]_m$. Suppose that also $[a]_m[b]_m = [0]_m$ for some $ b \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. Suppose we multiply $[a]_m[b]_m = [0]_m$ by $[a']_m$, we have \[\begin{aligned}\relax
[a]_m[b]_m &= [0]_m\\
([a']_m[a]_m)[b]_m &= [a']_m[0]_m\\
[b]_m &= [0]_m
\end{aligned}\]

Therefore, the only possible $b$ that satisfies $[a]_m[b]_m = [0]_m$ is $0$, therefore $[a]_m$ cannot be both invertible and a zero divisor.

\textbf{Theorem}:

In $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$, multiplicative inverses are unique whenever they exist.

\textbf{Proof}:

Let $[a]_m \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ be an invertible element and suppose $[a]_2$ has two inverses $b_1, b_2$: \[[a]_m[b_1]_m = [1]_m\;\;\;\;[a]_m[b_2]_m = [1]_m\] We can attempt to evaluate $[b_1]_m[a]_m[b_2]_m$:\[([b_1]_m[a]_m)[b_2]_m = [b_2]_m\;\;\;\;[b_1]_m([a]_m[b_2]_m) = [b_1]_m\]

We can see that depending on the order of operations taken, we get either $b_1$ or $b_2$. but as $[b_1]_m[a]_m[b_2]_m$ is always the same value, we can conclude that $b_1 = b_2$.

\textbf{Theorem}:

$[a]_m$ is an invertible class $\Leftrightarrow$ $\gcd(a,m) = 1$

\textbf{Proof}:

$(\Rightarrow)$: If $[a]_m$ is invertible, then there exists $[b]_m \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ such that $[a]_m[b]_m = [1]_m$. We can see that $ab = 1 + km$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. We can rearrange this to $ab + (-k)m = 1$. As the $\gcd(a,m)$ is the smallest natural number to $ax+my$, we have $ab + (-k)m = 1$ so $\gcd(a,m) = 1$.

$(\Leftarrow)$: The same logic applies but in the reverse direction.

\textbf{Theorem}:

$[a]_m$ is a zero divisor $\Leftrightarrow$ $\gcd(a,m) > 1$

\textbf{Proof}:

$(\Rightarrow)$: If $[a]_m$ is a zero divisor, $[a]_m$ is not invertible (by previous theorem: an element cannot be both invertible and zero divisor). So $\gcd(a,m) \neq 1$. As $\gcd(a,m) \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\gcd(a,m) \neq 1$, $\gcd(a,m) > 1$.

$(\Leftarrow)$: Suppose $\gcd(a, m) = g > 1$, let $b = m/g$. If we take the product $ab = a \cdot (m/g) = m \cdot (a/\gcd(a,m))$, we can see that $ab|m$ or $[a]_m[b]_m = [0]_m$; $[a]_m$ is a zero divisor.

\textbf{Theorem}:

If $[a] \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ is invertible and $[b] \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ is arbitrary, then the equation \[[a]_m x = [b]_m\] has exactly one solution. Namely, $x = [a]^-1_m[b]_m$.

\textbf{Proof}:

We can show the uniqueness of the solution by solving:\[\begin{aligned} \relax
    [a]_m x &= [b]_m\\
    ([a]^{-1}_m[a]_m) x &= [a]^{-1}_m[b]_m\\
    [1]_m x &= [a]^{-1}_m[b]_m\\
\end{aligned}\]

Therefore, $x$ must be $[a]^{-1}_m[b]_m$.

\section{Invertible elements in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$}

\textbf{Definition}:

The set of invertible elements of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ is denoted as $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ or $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^*$: \[(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times = \{[a]_m \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\;|\; \gcd(a,m) = 1\}\]

\textbf{Definition}:

The cardinality of $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ is denoted $\phi(m)$, where $\phi$ is the Euler Totient function. $\phi$ has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then $\phi(a,b) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$
    \item[(2)] If $p$ is prime and $k \geq 1$, then $\phi(p^k) = (p-1)p^{k-1}$
\end{itemize}

We proceed to prove these properties of $\phi$:

\textbf{Proof}(taken from HW3 Q2):

% TODO: inject proof for In $\mathbb{Z}/mn\mathbb{Z}$ where $\gcd(m,n) = 1$, the element $[a]_{mn}$ is invertible if and only if $[a]_m$ and $[a]_n$ are invertible as well.
(1): In $\mathbb{Z}/mn\mathbb{Z}$ where $\gcd(m,n) = 1$, the element $[a]_{mn}$ is invertible if and only if $[a]_m$ and $[a]_n$ are invertible as well. Therefore, each invertible element in $(\mathbb{Z}/mn\mathbb{Z})^\times$ correspond to a pair of elements in $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times \times (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$; there is a bijection betwen $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ and $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times \times (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$.

Therefore $\phi(mn) = \#((\mathbb{Z}/mn\mathbb{Z})^\times) = \#((\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times \times (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times) = \#((\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times) \cdot \#((\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times) = \phi(m)\phi(n)$.

(2): We wish to count all elements in $\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}$ that are invertible. Since we are working with a prime number $p$, it would be easier to count all zero-divisors instead. Namely, only the values $p,2p,3p,...$ divide into $p^k$ since $p$ is prime. Out of a total of $p^k$ classes, every $p$\textsuperscript{th} class is a zero divisor. Therefore there are $p^{k}/p = p^{k-1}$ zero divisors. Taking this amount ($p^{k-1}$) out of the total ($p^k$), we have $\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = (p-1)p^{k-1}$

\textbf{Theorem}:

If $[a]_m \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ is invertible, then $[a]_m^{\phi(m)} = [1]_m$. Note that this implies that $[a]_m^{\phi(m)-1} = [a]_m^{-1}$ because $[a]_m^{\phi(m)-1} [a]_m = [a]_m^{\phi(m)} = [1]_m$. In the case where $m$ is a prime number $p$, we have \textit{Fermat's Little Theorem}:

If $p$ is prime and $p \nmid a$, then $[a]_p^{p-1} = [1]_p$ in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.

\textbf{Proof}:

% TODO: inject proof for if [a], [b] are invertible, so is [ab]

Given $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$, we multiply each element by $[a]_m$. If we get $[a]_m[a_i]_m = [a]_m[a_j]_m$, then we multiply by $[a]_m^{-1}$, ensuring every element in $[a]_m \cdot(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ is distinct. If two elements are invertible, their product is invertible as well. Therefore, $[a]_m \cdot(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ is just $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ with rearranged elements. Now we take the product over $[a]_m \cdot(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$:\[\begin{aligned}
\prod_{i \in [a]_m \cdot(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times} i &= [a]_m ^{\#((\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times)} \prod_{i \in (\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times} i \\
&= [a]_m ^{\phi(m)} \prod_{i \in (\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times} i\\
&= [a]_m ^{\phi(m)} [1]_m \\
&= [a]_m ^{\phi(m)} \\
&= [1]_m
\end{aligned}\]

Notice that as $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ contains both invertible elements are their inverses, the product over every element in $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times$ would simply equal to $[1]_m$. From this we can see that $[a]_m ^{\phi(m)} = [1]_m$.

\section{Polynomials}

\textbf{Definition}:

A polynomial is a formal (symbolic) algebraic expression. A polynomial $f$ in the variable/symbol $x$ is of the form \[f = \sum_{i \geq 0} a_i x^i\]

where each $a_i$ is said to be a \textit{coefficient} of the corresponding $x^i$ term. It is critical to note that $x$ is a symbol and not an element of whatever number system $f$ is in.

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are defined in the standard way. Two polynomials are said to be equal if and only if their coefficients are the same.

\textbf{Definition}:

A polynomial $f$ is said to be \textit{monic} if its leading coefficient is equal to 1.

\textbf{Definition}:

The set of polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in a given number system $\mathbb{S}$ is denoted as $\mathbb{S}[x]$, we call this set $\mathbb{S}$ \textit{adjoin} $x$. For example, the set of all polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$ is denoted $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Common polynomial number systems include $\mathbb{Q,R,Z}$.

\textbf{Definition}:

The \textit{degree} of a polynomial $f$, denoted by $\deg(f)$, is the largest $n$ such that $a_n \neq 0$. If $f = 0$ (zero polynomial), then by convention $\deg(f) = -\infty$

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $f, g$ be polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, or $\mathbb{Z}$, then

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] $\deg(f+g) \leq \max(\deg(f), \deg(g))$
    \item[(2)] $\deg(fg) = \deg(f) + \deg(g)$
\end{itemize}

By $(2)$, there are no zero divisors in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, $\mathbb{R}[x]$, $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. If the coefficient number system has zero divisors (ex. $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$), then (2) does not hold.

\section{The Division Theorem in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$}

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $f, g \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ with $g \neq 0$. When dividing $f$ by $g$, there exists unique polynomials $q, r \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f = gq + r$
    \item $\deg(r) < \deg(g)$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proof}:

\textit{Existence}: We proceed by strong induction on $\deg(f)$. 

In the base case we have $\deg(f) < \deg(g)$, we take $q = 0$, $r = f$, in which case $f = gq + r = 0 + f$, and this satisfies $\deg(r) < \deg(g)$. 

In the inductive step, suppose $\deg(f) \geq \deg(g)$ and existence of $q, r$ is known for all lower degrees of $f$. We can cancel off the leading term of $f$ with one step of division: Let $f$ have the leading term $a_nx^n$ and $g$ have the leading term $b_mx^m$. We can define a lower degree polynomial \[\tilde{f} := f - \left(\frac{a_n}{b_m}x^{n-m}\right) \cdot g\] Note that the coefficient $\frac{b_m}{a_n}$ is valid in $\mathbb{Q}$.

By induction, the existence statement applies to $\tilde{f}$: there exists $\tilde{q}, \tilde{r}$ such that $\tilde{f} = \tilde{q}g + \tilde{r}$ and $\deg(\tilde{r}) < \deg(g)$. So, we rewrite $f$ in terms of $\tilde{f}$ and show that $q, r$ exists:\[\begin{aligned}
    f &= \tilde{f} + \left(\frac{a_n}{b_m}x^{n-m}\right) \cdot g \\
    f &= (\tilde{q}g + \tilde{r}) + \left(\frac{a_n}{b_m}x^{n-m}\right) \cdot g \\
    f &= \tilde{q}g + \left(\frac{a_n}{b_m}x^{n-m}\right) \cdot g + \tilde{r} \\
    f &= \left(\tilde{q} + \frac{a_n}{b_m}x^{n-m}\right) \cdot g + \tilde{r}
\end{aligned}\]

Letting$q = \tilde{q} + \frac{a_n}{b_m}x^{n-m}$ and $r = \tilde{r}$, we can see that we have satisfied the existence of $q, r$ for $f$.

\textit{Uniqueness}: Suppose $(q_1, r_1)$ and $(q_2, r_2)$ both satisfy $f = q_ig+r_i$ and $\deg(r_i) < \deg(g)$. We have $f = q_1g+r_1 = q_2g+r_2$. Alternatively, $f/g = q_1+r_1/g = q_2+r_2/g$. We require that $\deg(q_1) = \deg(q_2)$, so $r_1/g = r_1/g$. This implies that $r_1 = r_2$. In turn, this also implies that $q_1 = q_2$.

\section{Divisibilitty in Polynomials}

\textbf{Definition}:

Given polynomials $f, g$, we say that $f|g$ if $g = qf$ for some $q \in \mathbb{q}[x]$. This implies that $\deg(f) \leq \deg(g)$ if $g \neq 0$, which is useful for induction.

\textbf{Definition}:

Given polynomials $f, g$, we say that $f$ and $g$ are associates if $f|g$ and $g|f$. This means that $f = cg$ for some $c \in \mathbb{Q}$, so we can have $g = \frac{1}{c}f$.

Associate elements have the same divisors, which matters in uniqueness of factorization.

\textbf{Definition}:

Lef $f$ be a polynomial of degree greater than 0. We say that $f$ is \textit{prime} if $f|gh$ implies $f|g$ or $f|h$.

Further, we say that $f$ is \textit{irreducible} if its only divisors are associates of 1 and itself. Equivalently, $f$ cannot be factored as $f = ab$ where $1 \leq \deg(a), \deg(b)$.

From this definition we can see that every polynomial of degree 1 is irreducible.

\section{Evaluating Polynomials as a Function}

Since the arithmetic operations on polynomials are compatible with the operations on functions, we can evaluate $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ at any element $a \in \mathbb{Q}$.

We can say that equality of polynomials implies equality of functions. However, the converse is not true for over all number systems.

\textbf{Definition}:

We say that $a \in \mathbb{Q}$ is a \textit{root} of $f$ if and only if $f(a) = 0$.

\section{Root Theorem}

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, $a \in \mathbb{q}$. Then $a$ is a root of f iff $(x-a)|f$.

\textbf{Proof}:

$(\Rightarrow)$: By the division theorem, there exists $q, r \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $f = (x-a)q + r$ and $\deg(r) < \deg(x-a)$. Assume $a$ is a root of $f$, then $f(a) = 0 = (a - a)q(a) + r$, so $r = 0$. Therefore, $f = (x-a)q$.

$(\Leftarrow)$: If $f = (x - a) g$, then $f(a) = (a - a)g(a) = 0$, so $a$ is a root.

\textbf{Corollary}:

A nonzero polynomial of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ has at most $d$ distinctive roots.

\textbf{Proof}:

Refer to notes\_sep30\_2 for full proof. The rough gist is to apply induction on a polynomial $f$ and repeatedly apply root theorem each time to reduce its degree by 1.

\textbf{Corollary}:

If $\deg(f) = \deg(g) = n$ and $f(a) = g(a)$ for all $n+1$ distinct values of $a$, then $f = g$.

\textbf{Proof}:

Refer to notes\_sep30\_2 for full proof; or look at it from the linear algebra.

\textbf{Corollary}:

If $f, g \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ are equal as functions (i.e. $\forall a \in \mathbb{Q}\;\;f(a) = g(a)$), then $f=g$ in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Here, Equality of functions implies equality of polynomials, but only for $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.

\section{Polynomial Theorems}

% TODO: fit in heinsenstein's criterion somewhere

\textbf{Theorem}:

Given polynomials $f, g$, $\gcd(f, g)$ is a common divisor $h$ of \textbf{greatest degree}. That is if $\tilde{h}$ is any other common divisor, $\deg(h) \geq \deg(\tilde{h})$.

Note that if $h$ is a gcd of $f$ and $g$, so is any associate of $h$. If we are referring to the gcd of two polynomials, we mean the unique monic associate.

\textbf{Theorem}:

If $h$ is a gcd of $f$ and $g$, there exist polynomials $v, w \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that $h = vf + wg$. Moreover, every nonzero polynomial of the form $\tilde{v}f+\tilde{w}g$ is divisible by $h$.

\textbf{Theorem}:

A polynomial is \textit{prime} iff it is \textit{irreducible}.

Note that this is essentially Euclid's lemma for $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, $f$ is a product of prime/irreducible polynomials. Moreover, given two such factorizations, it is possible to reorder the factors so that the two factorizations match up to an associate.

This is the unique factorization theorem for $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. The proof for this theorem is similar to that of the integers.

\textbf{Theorem}:

If $f$ factors in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $\deg(f) = \deg(\overline{f})$, then $\overline{f}$ is reducible in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}[x]$.

The proof for this theorem is omitted but the key insight this theorem brings is that we can work with the contrapositive of this theorem: If a polynomal $\overline{f}$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}[x]$, then it is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. This resets the amount of possible elements to check for the root theorem down to $p$, rather than an infinite amount.

\section{Gauss's Lemma}

\textbf{Lemma}:

Suppose $f$ is reducible over $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, then $f$ also factors over $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, where each factors are associates of each other.

The proof is omitted for this lemma, but as a rough idea behind this proof is that an irreducible factor in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ could be rewritten as a product between an irreducible factor in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and a constant. (ex. $(x-1/2) = 1/2(2x-1)$)

\section{Rational Root Theorem}

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $f = \sum_{i}a_ix^i \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, suppose $f(r) = 0$ for some $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $r = a/b$ in lowest terms (ie. $\gcd(a,b)=1$). Then $a|a_0$ ($a$ divides the constant term of $f$) and $b|a_n$ ($b$ divides the leading coefficient of $f$).

\textbf{Proof}:

By the root theorem, $f = (x - \frac{a}{b})g$ for some $g \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. By Gauss's lemma, $f = (bx - a)g'$ for some $g' \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$. We can distribute the factor to get $f = bg'x - ag'$. Therefore, the leading term of $f$ will have a factor of $b$, and similarly the constant term of $f$ will have a factor of $a$.

\section{Ring terminologies}

\textbf{Definition}:

If $X, Y$ are sets, the Cartesian product of $X$ and $Y$ is the set of ordered pairs\[X \times Y = \{(x, y) \;|\;x\in X,y\in Y\}\]

\textbf{Definition}:

A \textit{binary operation} on a set $S$ is a function $* : S \times S \mapsto S$. This means that $*$ takes an ordered pair $(s, t) \in S \times S$ and outputs $*(s,t) \in S$. This is usually written in infix notation $s * t$.

Let $*$ be a binary operation on $S$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $*$ is \textit{commutative} if $\forall s, t \in S$, $s * t = t * s$
    \item $*$ is \textit{associative} if $\forall s, t, u \in S$, $(s * t) * u= s * (t * u )$ 
    \item An element $e \in S$ is an \textit{identity element} of $*$ if $\forall s \in S$, $e*s=s*e=s$
    \item Supose $*$ has an identity element $e$, given $s \in S$, an element $t \in S$ is an \textit{inverse} of $s$ if $s*t = t*s = e$
\end{itemize}

\section{Groups}

\textbf{Definition}:

A \textit{group} is an ordered pair $(G,*)$, where $G$ is a set and $*$ is a binary operation on $G$ with the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $*$ is associative
    \item There exists an identity element for $*$
    \item For every $g \in G$, there exists an inverse
\end{itemize}

Note that in the context of groups, $*$ is usually called the \textit{multiplication} operator.

In a group, $*$ is not required to be commutative. If $*$ happens to be commutative, then said group is an \textit{abelian} or commutative group.

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $(G, *)$ be a group, then the following holds:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] The identity element of $G$ is unique
    \item[(2)] The inverse of each element is unique
\end{itemize}

Note that (2) justifies using $g^{-1}$ to denote the inverse of an element $g \in G$.

\textbf{Proof}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] Suppose we have two identities $e, e' \in G$, then \[e = e * e' = e'\]
    \item[(2)] Suppose we have an element $g \in G$ and let $g
    , g'' \in G$ both be inverses of $g$. Then we have the following:\[\begin{aligned}
        &g'*g*g''\\
        = &(g'*g)*g''\\
        = &(e)*g''\\
        = &g''
    \end{aligned}\] Now proceed in the other direction by associativity:\[\begin{aligned}
        &g'*g*g''\\
        = &g'*(g*g'')\\
        = &g'*(e)\\
        = &g'
    \end{aligned}\] Therefore, $g' = g''$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $(G, *)$ be a group. 

\textit{Cancellation}: Let $a,b,c \in G$. $a * b = a* c \Rightarrow b = c$.

\textbf{Proof}:

Let $a,b,c \in G$ and suppose $a*b = a*c$:\[\begin{aligned}
    a*b &= a*c \\
    a^{-1}*(a*b) &= a^{-1}*(a*c) \\
    (a^{-1}*a)*b &= (a^{-1}*a)*c \\
    e*b &= e*c \\
    b &= c \\
\end{aligned}\]

\section{Rings}

\textbf{Definition}:

A \textit{ring} is an ordered triple $(R, +, *)$ where $R$ is a set and $+, *$ are binary operations (commonly referred to as addition and multiplication, respectively) on $S$ such that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $(R, +)$ is an abelian group
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $+$ is associative
        \item $+$ is commutative
        \item $+$ has an identity, denoted $0$
        \item Every $r \in R$ has an additive inverse $-r$
    \end{itemize}
    \item $*$ is associative
    \item $*$ distributes over addition: For every $a, b, c \in R$, $a * (b + c) = a * b + b * c$
\end{itemize}


Note that for the ring $(R, +, *)$, $*$ is not required to be commutative, if it is commutative, then $(R, +, *)$ is a commutative ring.

\textbf{Definition}:

If $(R, +_R,*_R)$ and $(S, +_S,*_S)$ are rings, we can define $R \times S$, a \textit{direct product} on $R$ and $S$ by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $(r, s) + (r', s') = (r +_R r', s +_S s')$
    \item$(r, s) * (r', s') = (r *_R r', s *_S s')$
\end{itemize}

$R \times S$ is a ring as well.

\textbf{Theorem}:

Let $(R, +, *)$ be a ring:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] For all $r \in R$ , $0 * r = r * 0 = 0$
    \item[(2)] For all $r, s \in R$ , $(-r)*s = r*(-s) = -(r*s)$
    \item[(3)] For all $r \in R$, $-(-r) = r$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proof}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(1)] As $0$ is the additive inverse, we have $0 = 0 + 0$. Therefore, $0*r = (0 + 0)*r$. After distribution, we have $0*r = 0*r + 0*r$, and so $0 = 0*r$. The same argument goes for the $r * 0$ case.
    \item[(2)] WTS $(-r)*s = -(rs)$. By definition of additive inverses, $r + (-r) = 0$. Suppose we multiply by $s$, we have $(r + (-r))*s = 0 *s = 0$.\[\begin{aligned}
        r + (-r) &= 0\\
        (r + (-r)) * s &= 0\\
        r*s + (-r) * s &= 0\\
        (-r) * s &= -(r*s)
    \end{aligned}\]
    \item[(3)] By uniqueness of additive inverses (of groups; recall that $(R,+)$ is an abelian group), the inverse of an inverse is the element itself.
\end{itemize}
